        Im am an up and comimg artist that has a pasion and love for drawing. My love for drawing started back in my home country Jamaica, growing up
      in jamaica was great but being the youngest in the family by a huge age gap i was always left alone with nothing to do, until one day
      while watching cartoons i said to my self "i think i could draw that". After a few trys i then got the hang of drawing cartoon Characters, so i
      started to create my own characters from my head of course it wasn't profesional but i enjoyed it alot. I was brought to America at the age of
      13 at which i then started High School, i Attended a Creative Arts school where i learned more techniques of drawing i graduated after four years
      and then went to college to study Grafic Design, but i only attened for 1 and a half now i draw from home.
